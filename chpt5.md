## Introduction to DI Anti-Patterns (Chapter Overview)

- **Contrast Between Anti-Patterns and Positive DI Patterns:**  
  Seemann and van Deursen open the chapter by comparing anti-patterns with positive DI patterns from Chapter 4, such as Constructor Injection and Method Injection.  
  *Supporting Detail:* This comparison helps establish a clear distinction between best practices and common pitfalls, setting the foundation for understanding DI anti-patterns.

- **Root Cause of Anti-Patterns:**  
  The authors argue that anti-patterns often originate from an incomplete understanding of Inversion of Control (IoC).  
  *Supporting Detail:* Misunderstanding IoC leads developers to hard-code dependencies within classes, which undermines flexibility and reusability.

- **Impact of Seizing Control Over Dependencies:**  
  Instead of letting dependencies be supplied externally, classes may seize control, resulting in implicit couplings.  
  *Supporting Detail:* Implicit couplings make systems rigid and difficult to modify, as changes in one part of the code can unintentionally affect other areas.

- **Violation of Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  This behavior breaches the DIP, which states that high-level modules should not rely on low-level ones; both should depend on abstractions.  
  *Supporting Detail:* Violating DIP leads to tightly coupled code, reducing modularity and making the system harder to scale and maintain.


## Distinction Between Volatile and Stable Dependencies

1. **Understanding Volatile Dependencies**
   - Volatile Dependencies are components likely to change over time, such as database access layers.
   - *Supporting Detail:* Mishandling these can make unit testing challenging because changes in external systems can cause tests to fail unpredictably.

2. **Recognizing Stable Dependencies**
   - Stable Dependencies refer to components that rarely change, like core .NET libraries (e.g., `string`).
   - *Supporting Detail:* These dependencies provide consistency in applications, reducing the need for frequent updates or changes.

3. **Impact of Mishandling Volatile Dependencies**
   - Anti-patterns often mishandle Volatile Dependencies, leading to difficulties in unit testing and brittle deployment processes.
   - *Supporting Detail:* This increases maintenance overhead, as small updates in volatile components can cause widespread issues.

4. **Role in Preventing "Big Ball of Mud" Architectures**
   - Recognizing Volatile and Stable Dependencies during code reviews or refactoring sessions can prevent poorly structured, hard-to-maintain architectures.
   - *Supporting Detail:* Proactively identifying these dependencies helps maintain clean, modular codebases that are easier to evolve.

5. **Evolution of Anti-Patterns in Dependency Injection (DI)**
   - Some anti-patterns, like Service Locator, were once common in early DI literature but are now considered obsolete with modern practices.
   - *Supporting Detail:* The built-in DI container in ASP.NET Core exemplifies how evolving frameworks promote better dependency management techniques.


The chapter uses C# code snippets throughout, assuming a .NET Core environment with interfaces for abstractions (e.g., `IProductRepository`). Examples are iterative, building on the Commerce application's `ProductService` class, which calculates discounts and interacts with a repository.

## 1. Control Freak

### Explanation and Author's Perspective
#### Understanding the Control Freak Anti-Pattern

- **Definition of Control Freak Anti-Pattern**  
  The Control Freak anti-pattern occurs when a class directly instantiates its Volatile Dependencies instead of allowing them to be injected.  
  *Further Detail:* This approach undermines the Dependency Injection (DI) principle by giving the class control over its dependencies, resulting in rigid, tightly coupled code structures.

- **Violation of Inversion of Control (IoC)**  
  This anti-pattern inverts IoC by making the class "control" its dependencies.  
  *Further Detail:* IoC is designed to delegate control of dependencies to an external framework or container. By taking control internally, the flexibility and modularity of the application are compromised.

- **Impact on Code Transparency**  
  It hides dependencies, making the class's requirements opaque.  
  *Further Detail:* Hidden dependencies make it challenging for developers to understand what external resources the class relies on, complicating debugging and maintenance.

- **Challenges in Unit Testing**  
  Unit testing becomes impossible without side effects, such as interacting with a real database.  
  *Further Detail:* This dependency on real services leads to unreliable tests that are slower and harder to maintain, as they rely on external systems.

- **Common Root Cause Among Developers**  
  Often a symptom of developers new to DI who revert to procedural habits.  
  *Further Detail:* Developers accustomed to traditional coding patterns may instinctively create instances within classes, not realizing the long-term drawbacks in a DI context.

- **Exacerbation in .NET Core**  
  In .NET Core, this issue worsens with service lifetimes (e.g., scoped vs. transient) because the class bypasses the container's management.  
  *Further Detail:* Ignoring the DI container disrupts the lifecycle management of services, leading to inconsistent behavior, resource leaks, or performance issues.


Minor topics covered include:
- **Distinction from Stable Dependencies**: Instantiating stable types (e.g., `new List<T>()`) is acceptable, but Volatile ones (e.g., `new SqlConnection()`) are not.
- **Edge Cases**: Factories or builders inside the class can mask Control Freak but still qualify if they create Volatile Dependencies.
- **Motivations for Use**: Convenience in prototypes or when dependencies seem "simple," but this scales poorly.

### Book's Example
The authors illustrate with the `ProductService` class in the Commerce application, which needs an `IProductRepository` to fetch products for discount calculations. In the anti-pattern version:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository repository;

    public ProductService()
    {
        this.repository = new SqlProductRepository();  // Control Freak: Directly instantiating a Volatile Dependency
    }

    public decimal CalculateDiscountedPrice(int productId)
    {
        var product = this.repository.GetById(productId);
        // Apply discount logic...
        return product.Price * 0.9m;  // Simplified discount
    }
}
```

Here, `SqlProductRepository` is a concrete implementation connecting to a SQL databaseâ€”a Volatile Dependency due to external I/O. The class "freaks out" by not relinquishing control, making it impossible to test `CalculateDiscountedPrice` without a live database.

### Why It's Problematic
- **Testability**: Unit tests can't mock the repository; integration tests are required, slowing development.
- **Maintainability**: Changing to a different repository (e.g., MongoDB) requires modifying `ProductService`, violating Open-Closed Principle.
- **Composability**: The class can't be reused in different contexts (e.g., in-memory for testing).

In .NET Core, this ignores the `IServiceProvider` ecosystem, where dependencies could be resolved with proper scopes.

### Refactoring to Proper DI
The authors recommend refactoring to Constructor Injection (from Chapter 4):

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository repository;

    public ProductService(IProductRepository repository)  // Injection point
    {
        this.repository = repository ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(repository));
    }

    // Same CalculateDiscountedPrice method
}
```

Now, the Composition Root (e.g., in `Startup.cs` for ASP.NET Core) handles instantiation: `services.AddTransient<IProductRepository, SqlProductRepository>();`. This restores IoC.

### Alternative Example (If Book's Doesn't Relate)
For a .NET Core console app not tied to e-commerce, consider a `WeatherService` that fetches data:

Anti-Pattern:
```csharp
public class WeatherService
{
    private readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();  // Control Freak
    public async Task<string> GetWeatherAsync(string city) { /* Use client */ }
}
```

Refactored:
```csharp
public class WeatherService
{
    private readonly HttpClient client;
    public WeatherService(HttpClient client) { this.client = client; }
}
```
This leverages .NET Core's `IHttpClientFactory` for better management.

## 2. Bastard Injection

### Explanation and Author's Perspective
# Bastard Injection (Poor Man's Injection)

1. **Definition**  
   - Bastard Injection, also known as Poor Man's Injection, involves providing a default constructor or overload that internally instantiates dependencies.
   - *Supporting Detail:* This approach superficially appears to support Dependency Injection (DI) but undermines its core principles by reintroducing direct control over dependencies.

2. **Deceptive Hybrid Nature**  
   - It masquerades as DI-compliant while subtly reverting to the Control Freak anti-pattern for the sake of "convenience."
   - *Supporting Detail:* Developers might believe their code follows DI best practices, but hidden internal instantiation contradicts DI fundamentals.

3. **Common Occurrence in Legacy Code Transitions**  
   - Bastard Injection often emerges during transitions from legacy codebases, where old habits or constraints influence new designs.
   - *Supporting Detail:* Legacy systems may rely heavily on direct instantiation, making it tempting to maintain workaround patterns during refactoring.

4. **Developer Motivation: Convenience**  
   - Developers may adopt this pattern to enable "easy" object creation without the need for a Dependency Injection container.
   - *Supporting Detail:* While convenient in small projects, this shortcut complicates scalability, testing, and maintenance in the long run.

5. **Conflict with .NET Core DI Practices**  
   - In .NET Core, Bastard Injection conflicts with explicit service registration in `IServiceCollection`.
   - *Supporting Detail:* This conflict leads to inconsistent service lifetimes and unexpected behaviors, as internal instantiation bypasses the container's lifecycle management.

6. **Impact on Service Lifetimes**  
   - Internally created dependencies can have lifetimes that differ from those managed by the DI container, causing resource leaks or performance issues.
   - *Supporting Detail:* For example, a service expected to be singleton might inadvertently behave like a transient due to improper instantiation.

7. **Hidden Defaults Surprise Users**  
   - Bastard Injection introduces hidden defaults that can surprise and confuse developers interacting with the code.
   - *Supporting Detail:* Consumers of such classes may be unaware of these implicit dependencies, leading to unexpected runtime behaviors and debugging difficulties.


Minor topics:
- **Foreign Defaults**: Defaults from external assemblies amplify coupling.
- **Overload Variations**: Multiple constructors where one injects and another defaults.
- **When It's Acceptable**: Rarely, e.g., for local defaults of Stable Dependencies, but never Volatile ones.

### Book's Example
Using the Commerce app, the anti-pattern appears in `ProductService` with an overloaded constructor:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository repository;

    public ProductService() : this(new SqlProductRepository()) {}  // Bastard Injection: Default to concrete

    public ProductService(IProductRepository repository)
    {
        this.repository = repository ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(repository));
    }

    // CalculateDiscountedPrice as before
}
```

This allows `new ProductService()` for quick use but defaults to a real SQL repository, making tests hit the database unexpectedly.

### Why It's Problematic
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Callers don't know about the default, leading to runtime surprises (e.g., production config issues).
- **Testability**: Tests using the default constructor couple to the concrete implementation.
- **Maintainability**: Changing the default requires recompiling consumers.

The authors note this anti-pattern erodes trust in the class's API, as constructors should clearly declare requirements.

### Refactoring to Proper DI
Remove the default constructor, forcing injection:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    // Only the injecting constructor remains
}
```

For convenience in non-container scenarios, use a factory or explicit creation in the Composition Root.

### Alternative Example
In a .NET Core API controller:

Anti-Pattern:
```csharp
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger logger;

    public ValuesController() : this(new Logger<ValuesController>(new LoggerFactory())) {}  // Bastard

    public ValuesController(ILogger logger) { this.logger = logger; }
}
```

Refactored: Rely on ASP.NET Core's built-in DI to inject `ILogger<ValuesController>` automatically.

## 3. Constrained Construction

### Explanation and Author's Perspective

1. **Definition of Constrained Construction**  
   - Occurs when a dependency forces a specific constructor signature on its consumers.  
   - *Supporting Detail:* This requirement can result in rigid and awkward code structures that make future flexibility challenging.

2. **Impact on Composability**  
   - Seemann and van Deursen argue this anti-pattern stifles composability.  
   - *Supporting Detail:* It assumes a fixed creation mechanism, restricting the ability to swap out components easily in different scenarios.

3. **Lack of Abstraction**  
   - Constrained Construction assumes concrete creation mechanisms rather than abstracting dependencies.  
   - *Supporting Detail:* This leads to tighter coupling between classes, reducing modularity and increasing maintenance effort.

4. **Common in Third-Party Libraries**  
   - Typically found in third-party libraries that aren't designed with Dependency Injection (DI) in mind.  
   - *Supporting Detail:* These libraries often prioritize ease of use over flexible design, inadvertently introducing coupling issues.

5. **Conflict with .NET Core Patterns**  
   - Clashes with extensible registration patterns in .NET Core, such as options builders.  
   - *Supporting Detail:* In .NET Core, DI thrives on flexible registration patterns, but Constrained Construction imposes fixed requirements that hinder this flexibility.

Minor topics:
- **Implicit Constraints**: E.g., requiring parameterless constructors for serialization.
- **Provider Patterns**: Using "providers" that dictate signatures, which the authors dismiss as non-patterns.
- **Edge Cases**: Constraints from frameworks (e.g., WCF proxies).

### Book's Example
In the Commerce app, suppose `SqlProductRepository` requires a connection string in its constructor, but a higher-level service must adapt:

Anti-Pattern (Constrained by dependency):
```csharp
public class SqlProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    public SqlProductRepository(string connectionString) { /* ... */ }
}

public class ProductService
{
    // Forced to handle connectionString, even if not its concern
    public ProductService(string connectionString)
    {
        this.repository = new SqlProductRepository(connectionString);
    }
}
```

This constrains `ProductService` to know about strings, breaking abstraction layers.

### Why It's Problematic
- **Coupling**: Consumers inherit irrelevant details from dependencies.
- **Flexibility**: Hard to swap implementations without API changes.
- **Testability**: Mocks must mimic the constraint.

### Refactoring to Proper DI
Introduce abstractions or factories:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    public ProductService(IProductRepository repository) { /* Injection */ }
}
```

Configure in Composition Root: `services.AddTransient<IProductRepository>(sp => new SqlProductRepository(Configuration.GetConnectionString("Default")));`.

### Alternative Example
For .NET Core configuration: A service constrained by `IConfiguration` directly, instead of injecting options.

Anti-Pattern:
```csharp
public class ConfigService
{
    public ConfigService(IConfiguration config) { /* Constrained to full config */ }
}
```

Refactored: Use `IOptions<MyOptions>` for focused injection.

## 4. Service Locator

### Explanation and Author's Perspective
- **Definition of Service Locator:**  
  Service Locator involves using a static or passed-in resolver that classes utilize to fetch dependencies at runtime.  
  *Supporting Detail:* This means that instead of declaring dependencies explicitly, classes request them dynamically, which obscures the actual requirements of the class.

- **Condemnation as an Anti-Pattern:**  
  The authors strongly condemn this as an anti-pattern because it hides dependencies within method bodies, violating the principle of explicitness.  
  *Supporting Detail:* This hidden nature makes the code harder to understand and maintain, as developers canâ€™t easily identify all the necessary dependencies by simply reviewing the class constructor.

- **Seemann's Critique:**  
  Seemann famously identified Service Locator as an anti-pattern in his blog, arguing that it turns Dependency Injection (DI) into a "magic black box."  
  *Supporting Detail:* This "black box" effect occurs because the dependency resolution process becomes opaque, making debugging and testing significantly more challenging.

- **Temptation in .NET Core:**  
  In .NET Core, the built-in `IServiceProvider` can tempt developers to adopt this pattern.  
  *Supporting Detail:* Although `IServiceProvider` offers a convenient way to resolve services, overusing it within application code rather than at the Composition Root leads to poor design practices.

- **Proper Usage Recommendation:**  
  Proper usage of `IServiceProvider` should be limited to the Composition Root.  
  *Supporting Detail:* By confining dependency resolution to the Composition Root, developers maintain clear, explicit dependency declarations in their classes, enhancing code maintainability and testability.


Minor topics:
- **Static vs. Injected Locator**: Both hide deps; injected is slightly better but still flawed.
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Useful for plugins, but overused.
- **Comparison to DI Containers**: Locators are containers in disguise, but without composition benefits.

### Book's Example
In Commerce:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IServiceLocator locator;

    public ProductService(IServiceLocator locator)
    {
        this.locator = locator;
    }

    public decimal CalculateDiscountedPrice(int productId)
    {
        var repository = this.locator.GetInstance<IProductRepository>();  // Service Locator
        var product = repository.GetById(productId);
        // ...
    }
}
```

Dependencies are resolved internally, obscuring what `ProductService` truly needs.

### Why It's Problematic
- **Hidden Dependencies**: No constructor signals requirements; discovery requires code inspection.
- **Testability**: Mocks must configure the locator, complicating setups.
- **Maintainability**: Refactoring breaks if resolutions change; violates SOLID (e.g., Interface Segregation).

The authors note it promotes god classes and hinders parallel development.

### Refactoring to Proper DI
Convert to Constructor Injection:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository repository;

    public ProductService(IProductRepository repository) { this.repository = repository; }
}
```

Reserve `IServiceProvider` for factories or rare dynamic needs in the Root.

### Alternative Example
In ASP.NET Core middleware:

Anti-Pattern:
```csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate next;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) { this.next = next; }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var service = context.RequestServices.GetService<IMyService>();  // Locator via HttpContext
        // Use service
    }
}
```

Refactored: Inject via constructor: `public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IMyService service) { ... }`.

## Chapter Summary and Broader Implications
* Seemann and van Deursen conclude that avoiding anti-patterns leads to cleaner, more testable code.
* They preview Chapter 6â€™s refactorings, which build on this catalog.
* From their perspective, DI is a mindset: always favor explicit, injectable dependencies.
* In .NET Core, leveraging the frameworkâ€™s DI (e.g., `AddScoped`, `AddSingleton`) amplifies these benefits, enabling scalable apps.
* Independent research confirms the authorsâ€™ views: Studies on DI anti-patterns in Java and .NET systems show these patterns correlate with higher bug rates and refactoring costs.
* For unillustrated concepts like multi-tenancy impacts, consider a tenant-aware repository: Control Freak would hardcode tenant IDs, while proper DI injects a `ITenantContext`.
* This ensures the chapterâ€™s lessons apply broadly.
